Division of Labor:

In the first week, Lucy and Jessica outlined and coded a naive version, and then outlined
an iterative approach to minimax of two plays. This iterative approach was feasible only 
because minimax was looking two plays in the future. Lucy implemented the iterative minimax.

In the second week, Jessica resolved the inconsistent segfaults caused by forgetting to
consider edge cases in the first iterative approach. Next, Jessica and Lucy outlined in 
pseudocode a recursive approach to minimax to allow for more than two plays in the future. 
After implementing and debugging it together, they began to play around with parameters to 
beat other players and optimize.
